// What you'll learn
// =================================================================================================

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to use Hazelcast distributed caching with Spring Boot, bundle with openliberty and
deploy to a local {kube} cluster.
You will then create a Kubernetes Service which load balance between containers and 
verify that you can share data between Microservices.

Caching plays an important role in high performing microservices. Hazelcast keeps frequently accessed data in-memory
so you can store your database queries,lookup data or http sessions for fast access. Hazelcast is elastic so it scale out/in 
easily on commodity hardware. Data is automatically distributed among new hazelcast cluster members.

The microservice you will deploy is called `hazelcast-caching`. The `hazelcast-caching` microservice simply
helps you put a data and read it back. As Kubernetes Service will send the request to different pod each time 
you initiate the request, the data will be served by shared hazelcast cluster between `hazelcast-caching` pods.

You will use a local single-node {kube} cluster. However, you can deploy this application on any kubernetes distributions 
such as IBM Cloud Private.

== What is {hazelcast}?

[Hazelcast](https://hazelcast.org/) is an open source In-Memory Data Grid (IMDG). It provides elastically scalable distributed In-Memory computing, 
widely recognized as the fastest and most scalable approach to application performance.

Hazelcast is designed to scale up to hundreds and thousands of members. 
Simply add new members and they will automatically discover the cluster 
and will linearly increase both memory and processing capacity

== Caching Strategies

Hazelcast supports multiple cloud-native options when it comes to deployment.

- embedded: Hazelcast starts with each of your microservice and joins to the existing Hazelcast Cluster 
- client/server: Microservices can connect to a remote Hazelcast Cluster 
- Hazelcast Cloud: Microservices can can keep their data in serverless manner with [Hazelcast Cloud](https://cloud.hazelcast.com/)

This guide uses embedded option.

== Why Spring Boot?
Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".

// Use Hazelcast Caching in Spring Boot Application
// =================================================================================================

== Use Hazelcast Caching in Spring Boot Application

The microservice in the `start` directory has in-process cache which is not accessible between microservices.

Firstly, you need to configure Hazelcast to be used in Spring Boot Application.
replace `Application.java` with the following java class.

[source, java]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/hazelcast/Application.java[tags=**;]
----

This configuration will tell Spring Boot what kind of configuration is needed when each hazelcast member is started.

Now it is time to use Hazelcast in the hazelcast-caching microservice.
if you check the source code of `CommandController.java`, you would notice that `ConcurrentHashMap` is used 
for backing key value store. In order to make this cache distributed, replace `CommandController.java`
with Hazelcast version.

[source, java]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/hazelcast/CommandController.java[tags=**;]
----

You would notice that getting hazelcast member is `Autowired` by Spring Boot and made available to the `CommandController`
and there is no change in `/put` and `/get` endpoints.

// =================================================================================================
// Building and containerizing the microservices
// =================================================================================================

== Building and containerizing microservice

The first step of deploying to {kube} is to build your microservices and containerize them with Docker.

The starting Java project, which you can find in the `start` directory, is a spring boot based microservice.
It is called hazelcast-caching which has two simple endpoints, `/put` and `/get`. This guide uses `boost-maven-plugin` 
to bundle spring boot app and openliberty together and build docker image for the deployment.
Boost plugin does not require you to create your own Dockerfile but instead opionated docker image.

If you wanna learn more about `boost maven plugin`, you can visit the project website.
https://github.com/OpenLiberty/boost/tree/master/boost-maven

If you want to create your own Dockerfile then you can always use dockerfile-maven plugin. 
please refer to https://openliberty.io/guides/kubernetes-intro.html#starting-and-preparing-your-cluster-for-deployment

To build `hazelcast-caching` microservice, run the following command in the `start` folder.
This will build the docker image and push it to docker registry provided by minikube

[role='command']
```
mvn package
```
Execute following command to see available docker images

[role='command']
```
docker images
```

Verify that the `hazelcast-caching:latest` is listed among them, for example:

If you don't see the `hazelcast-caching:latest` image, then check the Maven build log for any potential errors.
In addition, if you are using Minikube, make sure your Docker CLI is configured to use Minikube's Docker daemon and not your host's as described in the previous section.


// =================================================================================================
// Deploying the microservices
// =================================================================================================

== Deploying the microservices

Now that your Docker images are built, deploy them using a Kubernetes resource definition.
To deploy the `hazelcast-caching` microservice, first create the `kubernetes.yaml` file in the `start` directory:

[source, yaml]
----
include::finish/kubernetes.yaml[tags=**;]
----

This file defines two {kube} resources: one statefulset and one service. 
StatefulSet is preferred solution for Hazelcast because it enables controlled scale out/in of your microservices 
for easy data distribution. To learn more about StatefulSet, you can visit Kubernetes documentation
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateful-application/basic-stateful-set/

By default, we create 2 replicas of `hazelcast-caching` microservice behind the `hazelcast-caching-service` which forwards
requests to one of the pods available in the kubernetes cluster.

`MY_POD_NAME` is an environment variable made available to the pods so that each microservice knows which pod they are in.
This is going to be used in this guide in order to show which pod is responding to the http request.

As a second step, we will create rbac.yaml 

[source, yaml]
----
include::finish/rbac.yaml[tags=**;]
----

Role Based Access Controller(RBAC) configuration is used to give access to Kubernetes Master API from pods which runs 
microservices. Hazelcast requires a read access to autodiscover other hazelcast members and form hazelcast cluster.

Run the following commands to deploy the resources as defined in kubernetes.yaml and rbac.yaml in the specified order:

[role='command']
```
kubectl apply -f rbac.yaml
```

[role='command']
```
kubectl apply -f kubernetes.yaml
```

run the following command to check the status of your pods:

[role='command']
```
kubectl get pods
```

You'll see an output similar to the following if all the pods are healthy and running:

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
NAME                              READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
hazelcast-caching-statefulset-0   1/1       Running   0          20m
hazelcast-caching-statefulset-1   1/1       Running   0          20m
----

You should also check if hazelcast cluster is formed by checking one of the pod's log file:

```
kubectl logs hazelcast-caching-statefulset-1
```

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
Members {size:2, ver:2} [
	Member [172.17.0.4]:5701 - 71009ef7-ee18-45f0-8a8f-e9321931e9ce this
	Member [172.17.0.5]:5701 - 99222e16-93e5-4453-ac9e-cdf3e80069c6
]
----

Next you will make requests to your services.

****
[system]#*{win} | {mac}*#

The default hostname for Docker Desktop is `localhost`.

[system]#*{linux}*#

The default hostname for minikube is {minikube-ip}. Otherwise it can be found using the `minikube ip` command.
****

Open your favorite terminal and send http get requests in a loop via `curl` command. 
This request asks for the value of `key=1` and prints value and which pod has replied to the request.
You might need to wait up to 30 sec before microservices accepts traffic.

```
while true; do curl 192.168.99.100:31000/get?key=1;echo; sleep 2; done
```

You should see an output like below. The `value` is null because we have not put any data yet.
`podname` shows that which kubernetes pod replied to the request.
[source, role="no_copy"]
----
{"value":null,"podName":"hazelcast-caching-statefulset-1"}
{"value":null,"podName":"hazelcast-caching-statefulset-1"}
{"value":null,"podName":"hazelcast-caching-statefulset-0"}
{"value":null,"podName":"hazelcast-caching-statefulset-1"}
{"value":null,"podName":"hazelcast-caching-statefulset-0"}
----

Break the current loop and put some data into hazelcast-caching microservice.

[role='command']
```
curl "http://192.168.99.100:31000/put?key=1&value=hazelcast_springboot_openliberty"
```

Although request has been executed by one specific kubernetes pod, by querying the data in a loop will show data the data 
is actually shared by multiple pods. To see this, execute following command again.

[role='command']
```
while true; do curl 192.168.99.100:31000/get?key=1;echo; sleep 2; done
```

As you can see both pods are returning the same data.

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
{"value":"hazelcast_springboot_openliberty","podName":"hazelcast-caching-statefulset-1"}
{"value":"hazelcast_springboot_openliberty","podName":"hazelcast-caching-statefulset-0"}
{"value":"hazelcast_springboot_openliberty","podName":"hazelcast-caching-statefulset-1"}
{"value":"hazelcast_springboot_openliberty","podName":"hazelcast-caching-statefulset-0"}
{"value":"hazelcast_springboot_openliberty","podName":"hazelcast-caching-statefulset-1"}
----

// =================================================================================================
// Scaling with Hazelcast
// =================================================================================================

== Scaling with Hazelcast

Scale the cluster with one more pod and see that you still retrieve the shared data.

[role='command']
```
kubectl scale statefulset hazelcast-caching-statefulset --replicas=3
```

Run following command to see the latest status of the pods
[role='command']
```
kubectl get pods
```

As you can see, a new pod `hazelcast-caching-statefulset-2` has joined to the cluster.
[source, role="no_copy"]
----
NAME                              READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
hazelcast-caching-statefulset-0   1/1       Running   0          8m
hazelcast-caching-statefulset-1   1/1       Running   0          8m
hazelcast-caching-statefulset-2   1/1       Running   0          31s
----

Run the following command again to see the output
[role='command']
```
while true; do curl 192.168.99.100:31000/get?key=1;echo; sleep 2; done
```

As you can see, `hazelcast-caching-statefulset-2` is returning correct data.

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
{"value":"hazelcast_springboot_openliberty","podName":"hazelcast-caching-statefulset-1"}
{"value":"hazelcast_springboot_openliberty","podName":"hazelcast-caching-statefulset-2"}
{"value":"hazelcast_springboot_openliberty","podName":"hazelcast-caching-statefulset-0"}

The `testHazelcastCache` test makes sure that the `/put` endpoint is handled by one pod
and `/get` methods returns the same data from the other kubernetes pod.

It first puts a key/value pair to `hazelcast-caching` microservice and keeps podname in the `firstpod`
variable. In the second part, tests submits multiple `/get` requests until to see that podname is different then the pod 
which initially handled `/put` request.

In order to run integration tests, you must have a running `hazelcast-caching` microservices 
in minikube environment. As you have gone through all previous steps, you already have it.

The default properties defined in the pom.xml are:
[cols="15, 100", options="header"]
|===
| *Property*                        | *Description*
| [hotspot=35]`cluster.ip`            | IP or hostname for your cluster, `{minikube-ip}` by default, which is appropriate when using Minikube.
| [hotspot=36]`cluster.port`          | Port of the {kube} Service wrapping the `hazelcast-caching` pods, `hazelcast-caching-service` by default.
|===

Navigate back to the `start` directory.

****
[system]#*{linux} | {mac}*#

Run the integration tests against a cluster running at the default Minikube IP address:
[role='command']
```
mvn verify
```

[system]#*{win}*#

Run the integration tests against a cluster running with a hostname of `localhost`:
[role='command']
```
mvn verify -Dcluster.ip=localhost
```

Run the integration tests against an external IP address and port, 
you can use `cluster.ip` and `cluster.port` based kubernetes service on your kubernetes cluster.
[role='command']
```
mvn verify -Dcluster.ip=192.168.99.100 -Dcluster.port=31000
```

If the tests pass, you'll see a similar output to the following:

== Tearing down the environment

When you no longer need your deployed microservices, you can delete all {kube} resources by running the `kubectl delete` command:
You might need to wait up to 30 seconds as stateful sets kills pods one at a time.
```
kubectl delete -f kubernetes.yaml
```

== Great work! You're done!

You have just created a Spring Boot application, bundled it with openliberty and deployed to {kube}. 
You then added {hazelcast} caching to the `hazelcast-caching`,tested with a simple curl command. 
You also scaled out the microservices and saw that data is shared between microservices
As a last step, you ran integration tests against `hazelcast-caching` that was deployed in a {kube} cluster.
